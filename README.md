# Getting Started 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode at http://localhost:3000

I have uploaded the .env file so that you can configure the db seamlessly although this is not a good practice. However if you want to configure a new Mongo Db Atlas shared cluster feel free to do so.
